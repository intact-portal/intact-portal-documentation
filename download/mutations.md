# Mutations

[This dataset](https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/intact/current/various/mutations.tsv) contains annotations of experimental evidence where mutations have been shown to affect a protein interaction.

Several types of mutations are captured and the terms used to described them can be found in the [PSI Molecular Interactions Controlled Vocabulary](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/mi).

## Dataset Description

* Mutation [MI:0118](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/mi/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FMI_0118): A change in a sequence or structure in comparison to a reference entity due to a insertion, deletion or substitution event. _This root term is used when there is a mutation present in a protein and the wild type version has not been tested or shown to interact in the referenced paper._
  * Mutation causing an interaction [MI:2227](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/mi/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FMI_2227): A change in a sequence or structure in comparison to a reference entity due to a insertion, deletion or substitution event that enables an interaction when compared with the wild-type, which does not interact.
  * Mutation decreasing interaction [MI:0119](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/mi/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FMI_0119): Region of a molecule whose mutation or deletion decreases significantly interaction strength or rate \(in the case of interactions inferred from enzymatic reaction\).
    * Mutation decreasing interaction rate [MI:1130](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/mi/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FMI_1130): Region of a molecule whose mutation or deletion decreases significantly interaction rate \(in the case of interactions inferred from enzymatic reaction\).
    * Mutation decreasing interaction strength [MI:1133](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/mi/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FMI_1133): Region of a molecule whose mutation or deletion decreases significantly interaction strength.
  * Mutation disrupting interaction [MI:0573](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/mi/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FMI_0573): Region of a molecule whose mutation or deletion totally disrupts an interaction strength or rate \(in the case of interactions inferred from enzymatic reaction\). 
    * Mutation disrupting interaction rate [MI:1129](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/mi/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FMI_1129): Region of a molecule whose mutation or deletion totally disrupts an interaction rate \(in the case of interactions inferred from enzymatic reaction\).
    * Mutation disrupting interaction strength [MI:1128](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/mi/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FMI_1128): Region of a molecule whose mutation or deletion totally disrupts an interaction strength. 
  * Mutation increasing interaction [MI:0382](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/mi/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FMI_0382): Region of a molecule whose mutation or deletion increases significantly interaction strength or rate \(in the case of interactions inferred from enzymatic reaction\).
    * Mutation increasing interaction rate [MI:1131](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/mi/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FMI_1131): Region of a molecule whose mutation or deletion increases significantly interaction rate \(in the case of interactions inferred from enzymatic reaction\).
    * Mutation increasing interaction strength [MI:1132](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/mi/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FMI_1132): Region of a molecule whose mutation or deletion increases significantly interaction strength.
  * Mutation with no effect [MI:2226](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/mi/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FMI_2226): A change in a sequence or structure in comparison to a reference entity due to a insertion, deletion or substitution event that does not have any effect over an interaction when compared with the wild-type.
  * Mutation with complex effect [MI:2333](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/mi/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FMI_2333): A change in a sequence or structure in comparison to a reference entity due to a insertion, deletion or substitution event that has a complex effect over the interaction when compared with the wild-type. A complex effect is such that cannot be described in increasing, decreasing, causing, disrupting or no effect terms.

## Output format description

We provide a tab-delimited flatfile download with the full dataset. Every instance of a mutation affecting a given interaction is given a unique identifier \(_“Feature AC”_\). Please notice that some mutations will affect more than one residue position range in non-consecutive order. Each one of these non-consecutive ranges is recorded in a separate line, hence there will always be a difference between the number of lines in the file and the number of unique mutations. Here is a brief description of the different columns used in the file:

* Feature AC: Accession number for that particular mutation feature.
* Feature short label: Human-readable short label summarizing the amino acid changes and their positions, compliant with the Human Genome Variation Society recommendations \(see [http://varnomen.hgvs.org/recommendations/protein/](http://varnomen.hgvs.org/recommendations/protein/)\) .
* Feature range\(s\): Position\(s\) in the protein sequence affected by the mutation.
* Original sequence: Wild type amino acid residue\(s\) affected, in one letter code.
* Resulting sequence: Replacement sequence \(or deletion\) in one letter code.
* Feature type: Mutation type, following the PSI-MI controlled vocabularies as stated above.
* Feature annotation: Specific comments about the feature that can be of interest.
* Affected protein AC: Affected protein identifier \(preferably UniProtKB accession, if available\).
* Affected protein symbol: As given by UniProtKB.
* Affected protein full name: As given by UniProtKB.
* Affected protein organism: TaxID and species name as given by UniProtKB.
* Interaction participants: Identifiers for all participants in the affected interaction, along with their species and molecule type between brackets.
* PubMedID: Reference to the publication where the interaction evidence was reported.
* Figure legend: Reference to the specific figures in the paper where the interaction evidence was reported.
* Interaction AC: Interaction accession within our databases. This can be used to obtain further information about the interaction.

Further columns will be added once the dataset is enriched with cross-references to other databases such as UniProt and Ensembl. We plan to provide mappings to genomic coordinates in the near future.
