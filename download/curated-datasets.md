# Curated Datasets

Curated datasets are publications tagged, either computationally or manually by a curator, as being relevant to a specific area of biology.

These are actively maintained and grow with every release.   
Please [contact us](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/support/index.php?query=intact) to request a new dataset relevant to your work.

  This dataset contains interactions which have been derived in the context of the EU Affinomics project \(Grant number 241481\). This comprises interactions directly submitted by the consortium partners as well as interaction derived from the literature. The current focus is on interactions derived by Proximity Ligation Assay [MI:0813](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/mi/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FMI_0813), a method pioneered by the group of consortium partner Ulf Landegreen.

This dataset has been used in [BioCreative II](http://biocreative.sourceforge.net/biocreative_2_ppi.html)\(Critical Assessment of Information Extraction systems in Biology\): Protein-Protein Interaction Task . The protein-protein interaction task focused on the prediction of protein interactions from full text articles, which are represented in the Biocreative dataset. The Biocreative dataset provided by IntAct is a resource for text mining development and testing. The data file \(source-text.txt\) that provides a mapping between IntAct interactions and the sentence\(s\) of the publication that allowed an IntAct curator to identify the interaction is available [here](http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/intact/current/various/data-mining/).

  This dataset was obtained in a collaboratice effort with Franck Chauvat, Corinne Cassier-Chauvat, Jean-Cristophe Aude, Magali Michaut, and Pierre Legrain from DBJC, CEA Saclay, Gif-Sur-Yvette, France. Cyanobacteria like Synechocystis sp. can be used as model organism as they undergo both oxidative respiration and photosythesis. Cyanobacteria have many features common to bacteria including a lack of compartmentalisation. This dataset is used to gather articles showing interactions relevant to plant photosynthesis, redox metabolism, resistance to metal and oxidative stress. Most interactors belong to Cyanobacteria species, with a focus on Synechocystis sp. \(strain PCC 6803\), TaxID 1148, but some interactors belong to species where biological events seen in Cyanobacteria may also occurs like plants for photosynthesis. Also, the dataset contains a number of hybrid experiments using electron transfer between proteins from different species.
