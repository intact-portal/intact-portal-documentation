# Expansion Method

## Why should you care about complex expansion ?

Some experimental methods such as Tandem Affinity Purification do generate molecular interactions that can involve more than 2 molecules. Despite the fact that the IntAct curation team do capture the molecular interaction as they were reported in the corresponding experiment, when you search using the intact web site, the tabulated results of your query are always shown as a set of binary interactions \(i.e. 2 molecules\). We would like to draw your attention to the fact that whenever the reported interaction was a co-complex we do apply an expansion algorithm that transforms this n-ary interaction into a set of binary interactions. While none of these agorithms is perfect and will very likely generate some false positive interactions, it is useful to present the data as expanded binaries for representation in tables and network graphs. Bear in mind that we will strive to differentiate in the search results which interactions are a real experimental binary from expanded ones: every expanded binary is tagged and can be filtered out on our website.

## Existing expansion algorithms

There are several known algorithms allowing to transform an n-ary interaction into a set of binaries. The illustration below present the two most common expansion models and illustrates their potential for the generation of 'false positives'.

* **Spoke expansion**: Links a given molecule \(the [bait](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/mi/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FMI_0496) when such experimental role is appliable, a random one otherwise\) to all the other molecules individually \(the [prey\(s\)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/mi/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FMI_0498) if such role is appliable\). If N is the count of molecules in the complex, it generates N-1 binary interactions.
* **Matrix expansion**: Links all molecules to all other molecules present in the complex. If N is the count of molecule in the complex, it generates \(N\*\(N-1\)\)/2 binary interactions.

Now the issue \(as illustrated at the bottom right of the diagram above\) with these two models lies in the fact that the real complex might not be articulated around the chosen molecule \(bait\) but instead, the chosen molecule might be linked to a smaller complex via a single binary interaction. The experimental technique used to obtain this data does not provide details about the binary links between the participants, so most binary interaction generated by spoke and matrix expansion would result in 'false positive' binaries. 

## Expansion methods in IntAct: a summary

* In IntAct we only use the **spoke expansion algorithm** for interactions involving more than two participants. 
* Spoke-expanded binaries can be easily identified with the **'Expansion method' column** in the results table. 
* A spoke-expanded binary interaction just informs that the two molecules involved were found together in the same interaction experiment, but **it does not imply that the two molecules are in direct contact** with each other. 
* You can learn more about how we distinguish between direct and different types of indirect interactions in the [Data Sources](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/documentation/user-guide#data_sources) section of this user guide.
