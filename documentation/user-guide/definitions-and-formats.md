The IntAct Molecular Interactions database provides its data in 4 different data interchange formats, PSI-MI XML, PSI-MI TAB, MI-JSON and XGMML while terms are defined in the [PSI Molecular Interactions Controlled Vocabulary](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/mi). Below are links to our schemas and some content explanations. For more information on how to use our data, please see our [User Guide](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/documentation/user-guide).

# Molecular Interaction Formats

An overview of schemas and full details for all xml and tab-delimited formats and our CV can be found on the [HUPO Proteomics Standards Initiative Molecular Interactions (PSI-MI) Group page](https://www.psidev.info/groups/molecular-interactions)

## PSI-MI XML

The PSI-MI XML (MI-XML, MIF) data interchange format is an XML-based molecular interactions format. The version currently used by IntAct when returning results in XML are the PSI-MI XML 2.5 and 3.0 versions. Documentation is available in the [HUPO-PSI GitHub repository](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/miXML) and the [PSICQUIC GitHub repository](https://psicquic.github.io/PSIMIXML.html).

## PSI-MI TAB (miTab)

The PSI-MI TAB data interchange format is a common tab-delimited molecular interactions format. IntAct currently supports PSI-MITAB 2.5 and PSI-MITAB 2.7, documentation is available in the [HUPO-PSI GitHub repository](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/miTab) and the [PSICQUIC GitHub repository](https://psicquic.github.io/PSIMITAB.html)

## MI-JSON

The MI-JSON data interchange format provides the core interaction data, including all binding features, in a more concise format than PSI-MI XML for use cases where the XML files are too large to transfer in a reasonable amount of time. It removes the following content:

- some free-text annotations

- interactor cross-references, while it retains the interaction cross-references

- interactor aliases, such as gene names, secondary UniProt IDs

The schema and full details can be found in the [MI Community GitHub repository](https://github.com/MICommunity/psi-jami/tree/master/jami-interactionviewer-json)

Use case: [ComplexViewer](https://github.com/MICommunity/ComplexViewer)

## PSI-MI FEATURE TAB

PSI-MI FeatureTab is a new common tab-delimited molecular interactions format. It takes inspiration from the existing PSI-MI XML and tab-delimited formats, which is actively supported by the MI worktrack. Documentation is available in the [HUPO-PSI GitHub repository](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/miTab) and the [PSICQUIC GitHub repository](https://psicquic.github.io/PSIMITAB.html)

## XGMML

The XGMML data interchange format is used for importing data from IntAct directly into network analysis software such as as [Cytoscape](https://cytoscape.org/). Documentation for the XGMML format is available in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XGMML). IntAct has developed its own [Cytoscape App](https://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/intactapp) for querying IntAct data directly from Cytoscape.

# Controlled Vocabulary (CV)

The CV for the annotation of molecular interaction, **Proteomics Standards Initiative for Molecular Interaction Controlled Vocabulary (PSI-MI CV)**, has been developed within the HUPO Proteomics Standards Initiative (HUPO-PSI).

The CV can be navigated at the [Ontology Lookup Service (OLS)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/mi).

New terms can be requested via its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/psi-mi-CV). 

# Mutations dataset

IntAct provides a bespoke [file](ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/intact/current/various/mutations.tsv) of annotations of experimental evidence where mutations have been shown to affect a protein interaction. A full description of this data can be found in the Mutation dataset description [here](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/download/datasets#mutations).
