# Curated Datasets

Curated datasets are publications tagged, either computationally or manually by a curator, as being relevant to a specific area of biology.

These are actively maintained and grow with every release.   
New datasets can be requested, if relevant to your work, by mailing [intact-help@ebi.ac.uk.](mailto:intact-help@ebi.ac.uk)

[![PSI 2.5](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/images/psi25.png?conversationContext=7)](ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/intact/current/psi25/datasets/Affinomics.zip)

  This dataset contains interactions which have been derived in the context of the EU Affinomics project \(Grant number 241481\). This comprises interactions directly submitted by the consortium partners as well as interaction derived from the literature. The current focus is on interactions derived by Proximity Ligation Assay \([MI:0813](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ontology-lookup/?termId=MI:0813)\), a method pioneered by the group of consortium partner Ulf Landegreen.

  The compilation of this dataset and its curation was carried out in collaboration with Perreau V.M. University of Melbourne, Australia. Interactions were investigated in the context of Alzheimers disease with a particular focus on APP \(A4\) protein. The articles to be curated were determined based on protein annotations and literature scanning.

  The Biocreative dataset is a large dataset of curated publications from the [Journal of Biological Chemistry \(2006\)](http://www.jbc.org/) and [Nature publishing house](http://www.signaling-gateway.org/aboutus/) which were manually curated by IntAct curators. This dataset has been used in [BioCreative II](http://biocreative.sourceforge.net/biocreative_2_ppi.html)\(Critical Assessment of Information Extraction systems in Biology\): Protein-Protein Interaction Task . The protein-protein interaction task focused on the prediction of protein interactions from full text articles, which are represented in the Biocreative dataset. The Biocreative dataset provided by IntAct is a resource for text mining development and testing. The data file \(source-text.txt\) that provides a mapping between IntAct interactions and the sentence\(s\) of the publication that allowed an IntAct curator to identify the interaction is available [here](ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/intact/current/various/data-mining/).

  This dataset consists of interactions of proteins that are involved in cancer. An ongoing literature survey was carried out to determine publications of interest. Protein annotations were also considered when choosing the publications to be curated.

* [**Cardiac**](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/query/annot:%22dataset:cardiac%22?conversationContext=7) - Interactions involving cardiac related proteins [![PSI 2.5](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/images/psi25.png?conversationContext=7)](ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/intact/current/psi25/datasets/Cardiac.zip)

  A collection of interactions relating to proteins identified as associated with the cardiovascular system. These annotations create a PPI network which can be used to advance the understanding of protein interactions within the cardiovascular system. The gene lists have been assembled by the Cardiovascular Gene Annotation group at the University College, London and the dataset has also largely been assembled by that group, funded by the British Heart Foundation grant RG/13/5/30112, with the help of IntAct curators located at the EBI. This work is a collaboration with the Cardiac Proteomics and Signalling Laboratory at UCLA, funded by NHLBI Proteomics Center Award HHSN268201000035C.

* [**Chromatin**](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/query/annot:%22dataset:chromatin%22?conversationContext=7) - Epigenetic interactions resulting in chromatin modulation [![PSI 2.5](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/images/psi25.png?conversationContext=7)](ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/intact/current/psi25/datasets/Chromatin.zip)

  Chromatin relevant protein-protein interaction studies have been curated by IntAct curators from peer reviewed literature. These comprise interactions which are involved in modulating, modifying or forming chromatin. This dataset aims at capturing major epigenetic interactions resulting in chromatin modulation. Most of the publications were derived from 'Chromatin Papers ListServe' maintained by Bone J.
  
 * [**Coronavirus**](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/query/annot:%22dataset:coronavirus%22) -  Interactions investigated in the context of Coronavirus [![PSI 2.5]
 
   Dataset of molecular interactions extracted from publications involving viral proteins from the Coronaviridae family and human proteins, along with a certain       proportion of other model organisms. The data features mostly protein-protein and some RNA-protein interactions and covers SARS-CoV2 and SARS-CoV primarily, with   some interactions from other members of Coronaviridae as well. Interactions between human proteins relevant for SARS-CoV2 infection have also been included.

* [**Cyanobacteria**](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/query/annot:%22dataset:cyanobacteria%22?conversationContext=7) - Interaction dataset based on Cyanobacteria proteins and related species [![PSI 2.5](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/images/psi25.png?conversationContext=7)](ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/intact/current/psi25/datasets/Cyanobacteria.zip)

  This dataset was obtained in a collaboratice effort with Franck Chauvat, Corinne Cassier-Chauvat, Jean-Cristophe Aude, Magali Michaut, and Pierre Legrain from DBJC, CEA Saclay, Gif-Sur-Yvette, France. Cyanobacteria like Synechocystis sp. can be used as model organism as they undergo both oxidative respiration and photosythesis. Cyanobacteria have many features common to bacteria including a lack of compartmentalisation. This dataset is used to gather articles showing interactions relevant to plant photosynthesis, redox metabolism, resistance to metal and oxidative stress. Most interactors belong to Cyanobacteria species, with a focus on Synechocystis sp. \(strain PCC 6803\), TaxID 1148, but some interactors belong to species where biological events seen in Cyanobacteria may also occurs like plants for photosynthesis. Also, the dataset contains a number of hybrid experiments using electron transfer between proteins from different species.

* [**Rare Diseases**](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/query/annot:%22dataset:Rare%20Diseases%22) - Interactions investigated in the context of Rare genetic disease [![PSI 2.5]

 This is a dataset of molecular interactions extracted from publications focused on the study of any rare disease. 'A rare disease' is defined according to the European Union Regulation on Orphan Medicinal Products (1999): a disease that affects not more than 1 person per 2000 in the European population. The dataset is enriched with experimentally proven impact of clinical mutations on interactions, and also with the non-clinical mutations which are found to have effect on protein functionality.
